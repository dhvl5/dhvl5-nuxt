      <h2 class="text-xl">I've always loved games more than anything, I have so many ideas with so much potential. I want to create this and that and so on, but then I started working as a Data Entry Clerk while pursuing my studies further, those were some of the worst days ever. The job was killing me from inside before I decided to drop out of college to do what I actually wanted to do. Since then, I've completed an internship and taught myself Unity3D within a few months, I am currently working within the industry and am actively creating 2D, 3D and AR apps/games.</h2>
